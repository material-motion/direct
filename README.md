# Direct

Direct is a tool that helps motion designers provide clear, precise motion direction for engineers.

As motion design becomes more and more prominent in apps, it’s becoming increasingly important to develop a standard for communicating direction from Motion Designers. Once an animation is finalized, simply handing off a video file to engineers makes it very difficult for them to recreate. Animations take a lot of engineering time to implement and are a lot of subtleties that could get lost in translation. As designers, it’s our responsibility to make sure that engineers have everything they need to quickly recreate this motion.
